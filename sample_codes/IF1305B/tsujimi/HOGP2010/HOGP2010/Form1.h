	In order to use these unmanaged functions from within the managed .NET environment, we need

	including the appropriate header files is not enough. 

	Note: In order to avoid potential name conflicts in the header files (which we still use),
	I have renamed the functions by adding "UM" (unmanaged) onto the end of them.  To find 
	documentation for the functions in MSDN, search for the function name without the extra 
	"UM" attached.
	Note2: In the header files (such as setupapi.h), normally the function names are 
	remapped, depending upon if UNICODE is defined or not.  For example, two versions of the
	function SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail() exist.  One for UNICODE, and one for ANSI.  
	If the wrong version of the function is called, things won't work correctly.  Therefore,
	in order to make sure the correct one gets called (based on your compiler settings, which
	may or may not define "UNICODE"), it is useful to explicity specify the CharSet when doing
	the DLL import.

		Before we can "connect" our application to our USB embedded device, we must first find the device.
		A USB bus can have many devices simultaneously connected, so somehow we have to find our device, and only
		our device.  This is done with the Vendor ID (VID) and Product ID (PID).  Each USB product line should have
		a unique combination of VID and PID.  

		Microsoft has created a number of functions which are useful for finding plug and play devices.  Documentation
		for each function used can be found in the MSDN library.  We will be using the following functions:

		SetupDiGetClassDevs()					//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		GetLastError()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows
		SetupDiDestroyDeviceInfoList()			//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		SetupDiGetDeviceRegistryProperty()		//provided by setupapi.dll, which comes with Windows
		malloc()								//part of C runtime library, msvcrt.dll?
		CreateFile()							//provided by kernel32.dll, which comes with Windows

		We will also be using the following unusual data types and structures.  Documentation can also be found in
		the MSDN library:

		PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DATA
		PSP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA
		SP_DEVINFO_DATA
		HDEVINFO
		HANDLE
		GUID

		The ultimate objective of the following code is to call CreateFile(), which opens a communications
		pipe to a specific device (such as a HID class USB device endpoint).  CreateFile() returns a "handle" 
		which is needed later when calling ReadFile() or WriteFile().  These functions are used to actually 
		send and receive application related data to/from the USB peripheral device.

		However, in order to call CreateFile(), we first need to get the device path for the USB device
		with the correct VID and PID.  Getting the device path is a multi-step round about process, which
		requires calling several of the SetupDixxx() functions provided by setupapi.dll.
